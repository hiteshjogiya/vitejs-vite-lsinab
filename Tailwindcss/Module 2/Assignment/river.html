            set up the Sabarmati Riverfront Development Corporation Ltd (SRFDCL), a special purpose vehicle, in May 1997 funded by the Government of India with a seed capital of ₹1 crore (US$130,000) for the riverfront development. Environmental Planning Collaborative (EPC) led by Bimal Patel prepared the feasibility report in 1998. Initially the proposal was to construct the riverfront to cover a stretch of 10.4 kilometres (6.5 mi) stretch from Subhash bridge to Vasna barrage and to reclaim 162 hectares (400 acres) of the riverbed. In 2003, the project extended to cover an 11.25 kilometres (6.99 mi) stretch and reclamation of 202.79 hectares (501.1 acres) and was put on fast track. The project estimated to cost ₹1,200 crore (US$160 million) which was to be recovered by selling of a part of reclaimed land for commercial and residential purpose.[3][7] Bimal Patel-led HCP Design, Planning and Management Pvt. Ltd, Ahmedabad was roped in as the main architect of the project.[1] The project encountered several delays due to concerns regarding water level, flooding, rehabilitation of displaced slum dwellers and the opposition from the activists involved with slum rehabilitation
